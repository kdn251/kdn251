Hey everyone, I'm Kevin, and I'm a software engineer at Google in New York City! 

I make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kevinnaughtonjr) about coding interviews and anything else related to programming and tech. I hope my content helps you land the job of your dreams and become a better engineer!

If you need help with interview prep check out the interviewing service I created to help teach people, [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/?ref=kevin).
